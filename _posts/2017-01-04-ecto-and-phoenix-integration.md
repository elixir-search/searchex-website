title: Next Milestone - Phoenix Integration
---

A few days ago I demonstrated Searchex at the [Silicon Valley Elixir
Meetup][sv].  We discussed options for future development, and the
consensus was that Phoenix integration should be highest priority.

Here are some of the big features we'll need for the integration:

- Searchex usable as an application in a server process
- streaming `create/update/delete` actions
- a 'docsource plugin' module, so we can feed from both the database and the
  filesystem 
- configuration documentation and example apps

So it's official: the next milestone for Searchex will be a working integration
with Phoenix!

I will present Searchex and the upcoming Phoenix integration at the [Erlang
Meetup][sf] in San Francisco on Jan 11.  Come on down!
